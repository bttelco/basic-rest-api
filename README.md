Basic REST API - What is it?

All services provided by btTelco were designed and implemented with interoperability in mind. This meaning that despite we offer some applications to perform some operations that are considered the main use cases for most users, we've also done our best efforts to provide a way for advanced users to implement their own features, services or products.

The best way to provide such, is through a well defined Application Programming Interface and btTelco makes two types of API available to its users: The Basic REST API and the Extended REST API.

The Basic REST API is available for all users, including the Standard Plan subscribers. With this API, will be able to send Text-to-Speech, SMS and USSD messages through your own applications. You'll be also allowed to query the status of a specific message after it was accepted for delivery.

With the Extended REST API, only available for Enterprise Subscription Plan, you'll be able to manage most of the features provided by btTelco, such as add, edit or remove sub-accounts, IVRs, Transfers, request and cancel DID numbers, etc.

Although the REST APIs are at the distance of a simple HTTPS request, we also provide implementations for some programming languages such as PHP, Python, C# and more are yet to come.
